# GYG Test

## Requeriment

- PHP 5.6 or more


## run
Just a simple command

`php solution.php http://www.mocky.io/v2/58ff37f2110000070cf5ff16 2017-11-20T09:30 2017-11-23T19:30 3`

## Next steps
I'd like more time for implemented unit tests with PHPUnit and Behavior test with Behat and tests solutions with streams
and measure times and server metrics and and of course validate and sanitize data to request and data to endpoint.

I implemented the concept separate of concerns and DDD, separate domain logic to infrastructure logic.
